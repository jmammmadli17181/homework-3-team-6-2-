            <h4>On November 6, Team06 informed 23 students about "Hour of Code" in the secondary school number 36. First, we shared brief informative thoughts about ADA university. Then we showed the basics of coding and algorithms in a practical way. The children's rapid adaptation to the image was fantastic. Students listened attentively and participated actively throughout the lesson. They then completed the tasks individually using the computers in front of them. With our support and help, they realized how comfortable it is to code and delve deeper into the algorithm.</h4>
